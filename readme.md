! Inkscape presenter

Show inkscape layers as separate slides.

# draw your presentation in inkspace using separate layers for different slides, all slides in one drawing
# slide layers should be named starting 'slide...', eg. 'slide 1', 'slide 2'.
# save your drawing as an svg image (normal inkscape fileformat)
# edit the slide-animation.js file to define which layers to display for every slide.
# add a script element at the end of your svg file to load the slide-animation.js file
# open in a browser (tested using chromium and firefox)
# press mousebutton to see next slide
